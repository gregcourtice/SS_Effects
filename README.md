# SS_Effects

This repository includes a suspended sediment dose-response dataset for fish (data.csv), and R code for data visualizations and  binary logistic regression fit to the dataset (SS_analysis.R). The dose-response dataset provides additional non-salmonid and egg/larvae observations included in Newcombe and Jensen (1996) and found elsewhere but not used in our study.
